# 30DayMapChallenge
All my @30DayMapChallenge 2022 entries

Hello fellow traveler! Enjoy all my entries in the famous Twitter #30DayMapChallenge 2022.
My workflow involves almost only QGIS (for this challenge I used the 3.22.5) and only rarely other softwares like Affinity Designer, Blender3D etc.
My goal was always to do all my tasks with only one software and as the time passes, I'm reaching a point where this is becoming possible.

Important notes:
- in every image you will find a very short description with the software used and a citation to the source data;
- it is possible that I will add a folder in the future containing all links to the data used for these maps, since they are all publicly available;
- feel free to contact me on my socials or email if you want to suggest something to make better maps, if you find mistakes or simply have a chat to share knowledge!

See you!
